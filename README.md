Double connected edge link explored
A Double Connected Edge List (DCEL), also known as a half-edge data structure, is a specialized data structure designed to efficiently represent planar graphs. Unlike simple graph representations, DCEL provides explicit information about the geometric and topological relationships between vertices, edges, and faces of a planar graph.
