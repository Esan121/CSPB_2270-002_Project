Double connected edge link explored
A Double Connected Edge List (DCEL), also known as a half-edge data structure, is a specialized data structure designed to efficiently represent planar graphs. Unlike simple graph representations, DCEL provides explicit information about the geometric and topological relationships between vertices, edges, and faces of a planar graph.
The idea behind this was to create a DCEL and manipulate it with multiple types of operations. Ran into many problems while trying to do so and may bit off more than i can chew, but it has motivated me to try and understand them more in the future.
